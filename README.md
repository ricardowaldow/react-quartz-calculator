# Quartz Calculator

This is a project of a calculator with the objective to find the better profit each round the Quartz game. It was a idea by me and my friends while playing.

### How to run

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```

Run the server:
```
$ npm run dev
```

It should be running on ```http://localhost:5173```.

You can acess, use and test it on https://quartzculator.github.io.

Please contact me if you find any bug.

Thanks! :)
